# web analytics project
#### 
This project focuses on evaluating the overall performance of the website to generate actionable insights. It examines the high cart abandonment rate, identifies possible causes, and assesses how website accessibility and ease of navigation impact user behavior. Additionally, the project analyzes how cart abandonment affects sales performance and total website visits, with the goal of highlighting areas for improvement and optimization.

#### data source

   #### exploratory data analysis 

- What is the total number of visitors to the website?
- What is the cart abandonment rate?
- Which country records the highest number of website visits?
- Which devices are most commonly used to access the website?
- Which devices provide the easiest and most convenient website access and navigation?

   #### data analysis result/findings

1. The analysis revealed that only 25% of total website visitors completed a successful purchase. This may be attributed to the fact that most successful transactions occur on desktop and tablet devices. As a      result, users attempting to make purchases on mobile devices may experience navigation difficulties, which likely contributes to the high cart abandonment rate.
2. The majority of website traffic originated from Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and organic search. This is expected, as paid advertisements and organic search results typically redirect users directly to the website upon interaction. In contrast, email and direct traffic channels recorded lower traffic volumes, possibly due to the additional effort required for users to access the website through these channels.
3. The volume of visitors using Firefox and Microsoft Edge is notable, as these browsers are generally more effective on desktop and tablet devices than on mobile. This further supports the observation that mobile users experience more difficulty completing purchases, contributing to the high cart abandonment rate

 #### reccomendations 
 
 - The website should be reviewed and optimized to ensure full compatibility and usability on mobile devices.
 - The website should be optimized to provide seamless access and performance on Chrome and Safari browsers, allowing customers to make purchases easily from any location.
 - The direct and email traffic channels should be re-evaluated, as they are less convenient for users and may lead to declining usage over time, resulting in unnecessary operational and marketing costs
